    """
    Calculates how much the total energy of the system would change,
    if the spin :math:`(i,j)` was flipped.
    
    The system is not changed in any way. The function only calculates
    how much the energy would change, if a spin was flipped.
    
    The total energy of the 2D Ising model is
    
    .. math::
    
        E = - \\sum_{a,b} J_{a,b} s_{a} s_{b},
        
    where :math:`a = (i,j)` and :math:`b = (k,l)` are spin
    coordinates, :math:`s_a, s_b` are the spin values at these
    coordinates (either 1 or -1), and :math:`J_{a,b}` is the
    coupling parameter between these two spins.
    
    * If :math:`J > 0`, the spins interact ferromagnetically, i.e., 
      they prefer to point in the same direction.
    * If :math:`J < 0`, the spins interact antiferromagnetically
      and prefer to point in opposite directions.
    * If :math:`J = 0`, there is no interaction between the spins.
    
    In our model, :math:`J = 1` for all spins which are directly
    next to each other (vertical and horizontal neighbors), 
    and :math:`J = 0` for all other spins (in some suitable units).
    This means that if only one spin, :math:`s_(i,j)` changes its sign,
    there are exactly four terms in the energy sum that change: 
    the terms with :math:`s_{i,j}` and its neighbors up, down, right and left,
    i.e., :math:`s_{i+1,j}, s_{i-1,j}, s_{i,j+1}, s_{i,j-1}`.
    Furthermore they change by changing their sign.
    For instance, if :math:`s_{i,j,\\text{before}} = 1` and :math:`s_{i+1,j} = -1`,
    initially the energy of this pair is        
    :math:`-J_{(i,j),(i+1,j)} s_{i,j,\\text{before}} s_{i+1,j} = 1`.
    After the flip, we would have :math:`s_{i,j,\\text{after}} = -1`, 
    and the energy of the pair would become -1.
    The *change* in energy would therefore be
    
    .. math ::
        \\Delta E_1 = 2 J_{(i,j),(i+1,j)} s_{i,j,\\text{before}} s_{i+1,j} = -2.
    
    The energies for the three other affected pairs are calculated similarly,
    so substituting :math:`J = 1` we get the total energy change
    
    .. math::
    
        \\Delta E = 2s_{i,j,\\text{before}} ( s_{i+1,j} + s_{i-1,j} + s_{i,j+1} + s_{i,j-1}).

    In the ising model, spins only point either up or down
