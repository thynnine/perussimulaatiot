Neural network for categorizing populations.

The data is from Fischer's Iris data set. See, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.

There are two versions of the code.
One is finished and works. It has the suffix _working.
The other is missing some parts of the algorithm and requires fixing.

See doc.pdf for the documentation.
